# Codebook for the tidy dataset continated in tidydata.txt

## Identifying variables - group, subject, and activity

  ** group **
  Two-level factor vector identifying which group subjects and their data were randomly assigned for the experiment presented in (Anguita et al 2012).
  test - 9 subjects
  train - 21 subjects
  
  ** subject **
  This is a 30-level factor vector identifying observations from the 30 individuals wore a Samsung Smartphone while performing various activities.
  
  ** activity **
  Six-level factor vector identifying observations corresponding to one of six types of activities:
  1) walk - Walking
  2) walkup - Walking upstairs
  3) walkdown - Walking downstairs
  4) sit - Sitting
  5) stand - Standing
  6) lay - Laying down
  
## Measurement variables

The averages of all means and standard deviation pairs by subject and activity type are presented

Only pairs of means and standard deviations from the measurements taken directly from the Samsung Smartphone device are included in the tidydata.txt

Variables preceded with a 't' refer to measurements involving time, and 'f' refers to measurements involving frequency. 

The 'XYZ' of some variables indicates measurements made in three-dimensional space

There is an average mean and standard deviation for each of measurements below, as well as each direction, XYZ, resulting in 66 variables.

For example, tBodyAcc - XRY produces in six variables:
tBodyAcc-mean()-X _and_ tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y _and_ tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z _and_ tBodyAcc-std()-Z

IN conrast, tBodyAccMag produces only two variables:
tBodyAccMag-mean() _and_ tBodyAccMag-std()

Here is the list of measurements producing the included variables

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
